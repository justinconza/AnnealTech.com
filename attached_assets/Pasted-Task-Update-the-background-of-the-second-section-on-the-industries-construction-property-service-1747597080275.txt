Task:
Update the background of the second section on the `/industries/construction-property-services` page (specifically the section with the headline ‚ÄúYour Sites Are Moving Fast. Is Your Technology Keeping Up?‚Äù) to match the visual style of the homepage hero section ‚Äî with an interactive, subtle digital blue background.

---

üéØ GOALS:

- Visually match the homepage hero section‚Äôs theme while keeping this section easy to read
- Use a **blue digital-inspired SVG or Lottie animation background**
- Background should respond slightly to **mouse movement (parallax or drift effect)**
- The animation should be **subtle and not aggressive** (avoid high motion distractions)
- Must work across devices ‚Äî degrade gracefully on mobile (static fallback or reduced interactivity)

---

üé® DESIGN DETAILS:

- **Color Base:** AnnealTech blue (`#0d4f86`) as dominant glow/accent
- **Style:** Digital mesh, network lines, glowing nodes, or abstract tech particles
- **Behavior:**
  - Interactive with mouse on desktop (slow, smooth parallax drift or cursor trails)
  - Lightweight SVG or canvas animation preferred
  - Static or low-motion background on mobile

---

üîß IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS:

- Use a **Lottie animation** (JSON-based) or **SVG background** set to absolute with `pointer-events: none`
- Use **Mousemove** event listener (with `requestAnimationFrame`) to create subtle depth/parallax on vector or gradient layers
- Example Lottie types: "cyber mesh", "blue network grid", "subtle wave particles"

---

üì± RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR:

- Desktop: animated + interactive
- Mobile: either static background image or lower motion Lottie version (if supported)
- Keep text highly readable (ensure contrast and layer blur if necessary)

---

üì§ OUTPUT:

- Modular HTML + CSS or component-based injection
- Replace only the second section background ‚Äî leave all content and layout intact
- Should align fluidly with the rest of the page scroll behavior and branding
