🔹 1. Page Layout Plan
Create a new page titled: Free IT & Security Tools

Page Sections:

Hero Section – Catchy headline + call to action

Tool Cards – One section per tool (title, benefit, “Launch Tool” button)

Why Free? – Short paragraph explaining your mission

Lead Capture – Optional form or gated tools (email to unlock premium ones)

Security Assurance – Note that data is never sold/shared

🔹 2. Design Mockup (Replit/Designer Input)
Give this to Replit or your designer:

“Build a responsive webpage using TailwindCSS and React or HTML/CSS. Each tool should be displayed in a grid card layout with icons, a short description, and a CTA button. Use a dark theme with orange accent colors to match AnnealTech branding. Include a header, footer, and optional modal for gated tool access.”

🔹 3. Technical Setup
Host tools on a subdomain (e.g., tools.annealtech.com) or embed in an iframe

Link tools from Wix with either:

External links to Replit-hosted tools

Custom code embeds

Set up basic tracking with Google Analytics or Plausible.io

Optional: Gate advanced tools with Notion forms, Mailchimp, or HubSpot
