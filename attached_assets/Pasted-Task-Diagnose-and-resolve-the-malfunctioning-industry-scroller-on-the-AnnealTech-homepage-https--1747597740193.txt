Task:
Diagnose and resolve the malfunctioning industry scroller on the AnnealTech homepage (https://anneal-devsite.replit.app/). The scroller should display industry cards in a responsive, interactive carousel format consistent with AnnealTech‚Äôs branding.

---

üéØ CORE OBJECTIVES:

- Ensure the scroller displays all industry cards correctly.
- Implement responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices.
- Incorporate interactive elements (e.g., hover effects, navigation controls).
- Align the scroller's design with AnnealTech‚Äôs branding: dark/light contrast, blue glows, clean grids, and tech-forward visuals.

üîç DIAGNOSTIC STEPS:

1. **Inspect the Scroller Element:**
   - Use browser developer tools to examine the scroller's HTML and CSS.
   - Verify that the scroller's container is present in the DOM and that it has the correct styles applied.

2. **Check for JavaScript Errors:**
   - Open the browser console to look for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the scroller from initializing or functioning properly.

3. **Review Plugin or Library Integration:**
   - If a third-party library (e.g., Swiper.js, Slick Carousel) is used, ensure it is correctly integrated and initialized.

4. **Test in Different Browsers:**
   - Check if the scroller issue persists across different browsers to rule out browser-specific problems.

üìê IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:

- **Structure:**
  - Use a `<div>` container with a class like `.industry-scroller` to house the industry cards.
  - Each industry card should be a child `<div>` with appropriate classes for styling and interactivity.

- **Styling:**
  - Apply CSS to create a horizontal scrolling effect with smooth transitions.
  - Use media queries to adjust the number of visible cards based on screen size.

- **Interactivity:**
  - Implement navigation controls (e.g., previous/next buttons) for manual scrolling.
  - Add hover effects to industry cards for enhanced user engagement.

- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure that the scroller is navigable via keyboard for accessibility compliance.
