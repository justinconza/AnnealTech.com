Task:
Redesign and expand the Non-Profit industry page on AnnealTech.com using a clean, secure, mission-aligned visual theme. **Do not alter the top hero section** ‚Äî preserve its layout, content, and visual identity. Begin all new content *below* the hero.

This page must reflect the unique needs of nonprofit organizations: limited resources, sensitive donor and constituent data, hybrid teams, and strict compliance mandates ‚Äî all while maintaining a compassionate, professional aesthetic.
