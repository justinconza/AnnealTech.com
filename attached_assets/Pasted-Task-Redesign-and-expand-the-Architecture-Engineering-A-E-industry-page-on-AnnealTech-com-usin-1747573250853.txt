Task:
Redesign and expand the Architecture & Engineering (A&E) industry page on AnnealTech.com using a digitally immersive, security-first design system. The top hero section should remain **unchanged** ‚Äî do not edit or alter the existing headline, layout, background, or animation. All new content will begin *below* the hero.

The goal is to clearly express how A&E firms benefit from managed IT, real-time collaboration, and rock-solid cybersecurity ‚Äî especially when handling CAD software, large file transfers, field-office synchronization, and sensitive client data.

---

üéØ OVERALL GOALS:

- Illustrate how modern architecture and engineering firms rely on secure, responsive IT environments
- Show how AnnealTech‚Äôs managed services improve uptime, secure complex systems, and enable seamless field-to-office operations
- Leverage a futuristic digital design language (glow accents, grids, animations)
- Maintain brand continuity with AnnealTech‚Äôs core colors, spacing, and typographic hierarchy

üìê SECTION STRUCTURE & CONTENT:

---

### 1. ‚ÄúTech Friction in A&E Firms‚Äù ‚Äì Animated Risk Grid

**Headline:**  
> ‚ÄúWhere Innovation Meets IT Bottlenecks‚Äù

**Visual Style:**
- Dark animated blueprint grid or flowing lines in background  
- 3 cards that animate on scroll (fade-in or zoom-in)  
- Each tile glows on hover with lifted elevation

**Cards (Examples):**
- *Disrupted CAD & BIM Workflows*  
  Large file corruption and poor sync delay project delivery.
- *Field-to-Office File Gaps*  
  Teams lose productivity when remote access isn't seamless.
- *Sensitive Client Data at Risk*  
  Without layered security, proprietary plans are exposed.
