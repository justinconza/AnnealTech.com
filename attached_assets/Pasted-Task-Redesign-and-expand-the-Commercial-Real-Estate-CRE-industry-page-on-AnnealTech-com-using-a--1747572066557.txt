Task:
Redesign and expand the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) industry page on AnnealTech.com using a futuristic, security-first design language. The page should tell a compelling story of risk, resolution, and resilience while visually reflecting AnnealTech‚Äôs immersive, tech-forward identity.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: **Do not alter the top hero section** (above the fold). It looks great and should remain exactly as-is ‚Äî including its layout, copy, background, and animation. All new content begins below that section.

This prompt includes: animated backgrounds, content sections, metric counters, value props, and a full-width Tailored CRE Services section using AnnealTech‚Äôs real service offerings.

- Build visual and psychological trust using real metrics and pain points
